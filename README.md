Project Overview
The AI Traffic Management System is designed to optimize and control traffic flow in urban areas using artificial intelligence and machine learning. By analyzing real-time traffic data from various sensors, cameras, and other sources, this system dynamically adjusts traffic signals, detects anomalies, and provides valuable insights to reduce congestion, improve safety, and enhance the overall efficiency of traffic networks.

Features
Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: Uses data from cameras, sensors, and other IoT devices to monitor and analyze traffic flow in real time.
Dynamic Signal Control: Adjusts traffic light timings based on real-time data, reducing congestion at critical intersections.
Traffic Anomaly Detection: Identifies incidents like accidents, unusual congestion, or roadblocks and alerts relevant authorities.
Predictive Traffic Analysis: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict traffic patterns and prepare for peak times.
Data Visualization and Analytics: Provides a dashboard for visualizing traffic conditions, congestion patterns, and historical data insights.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch for training and deploying traffic prediction models.
Computer Vision: OpenCV for processing video feeds to detect vehicles, pedestrians, and incidents.
Backend: Flask or Django to manage API endpoints and backend services.
Frontend: React.js or Angular for dashboard and data visualization.
Database: MySQL, MongoDB, or a time-series database like InfluxDB for storing traffic data.
Cloud: AWS or Google Cloud for hosting and processing large datasets (optional).
System Architecture
Data Collection Layer: Gathers data from traffic cameras, sensors, and connected IoT devices.
Data Processing and Analysis: Processes and analyzes incoming data in real-time using machine learning models.
Control Layer: Integrates with traffic signals to dynamically adjust timings based on analyzed data.
Visualization Layer: Provides a web-based dashboard for monitoring traffic conditions and system performance.
